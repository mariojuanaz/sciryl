WHY/WHEN TO START TRAVELING  ~ MOVING ON
"Sitting is the new smoking."

Yes, you read that right we are all killing ourselves one computer keystroke at a time. I first encountered that slogan a long time ago, time when Iâ€™m too afraid to go out, explore, or whatever adjective/s you can come up with that has risk attached to it. And again yes, you read that right, I am afraid. Afraid to be on my own, mingle with strangers, on unfamiliar terrain, eating strange food, venture on new activities and afraid to move on. We are all stuck somewhere, prisoner of a four walled office glued to our keyboard and smartphones.

One day, I just spent hours browsing photos of different places. Bookmarking travel blogs of different bloggers, reading itineraries after itineraries and watching vlogs (video blogs) on YouTube. It is killing me inside how these people can jump out there, living in the moment instead of thinking of their future or it is just me overthinking.
