Law and religion are beliefs
The rule of a system
The lies we tell our people
Oblivious is better than knowing, 
“The truth shall set you free is bullshit.”
It pulls you in deeper
The just are buried
The guilty will build their homes over innocent graves

I choose love over religion
I choose love over the law

The lines that you’ve read from speeches
With words so clever, where are they now?
Have you forgotten them all?

Yes I said it, so what?
Yes I said it, so what?
With tongues like knives
Our words will always hurt
Yes I said it, so what?
Yes I said it, so what?
With tongues like knives
Our words will always hurt

When will they see?
How can we ever get their attention?
When will they hear?
It’s a shame, really
It’s a shame, really
It’s a shame, really

When the truth that sets you free is bullshit
The wounds cut deeper, the just are buried
The guilty will rule them all

The innocent pays
The innocent pays

I choose love over religion
I choose love over the law
I choose love, I choose love
